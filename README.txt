Object oriented through he Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) written in lisp

If written with proper declarations LISP can run just as fast as C code!

Ideas first introduced in Lisp include the if/then/else construct, recursive function calls, dynamic memory allocation, garbage collection, first-class functions, lexical closures, interactive programming, incremental compilation, and dynamic typing.
